# Free Analytics Integration Guide for CHIMP.FUN

## üéâ Current Analytics Setup

Your website already has some analytics configured:

‚úÖ **Vercel Analytics** - Already installed and running  
‚úÖ **Vercel Speed Insights** - Already installed and running

These provide basic page views, performance metrics, and user engagement data.

## üÜì Additional Free Analytics Options

### 1. Google Analytics 4 (GA4) - Most Comprehensive Free Option

**What you get:**

- Detailed user behavior tracking
- Demographics and interests
- Real-time visitors
- Conversion tracking
- Custom events
- Free up to 10 million events per month

**Setup Instructions:**

1. **Get your Google Analytics ID:**

   - Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
   - Create a new property for your website
   - Copy your Measurement ID (looks like `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)

2. **Add to your environment variables:**

   ```bash
   # Add to your .env.local file
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
   ```

3. **Integrate the Google Analytics component:**
   I've already created a `GoogleAnalytics.tsx` component for you. To use it, update your `RootLayout.tsx`:

   ```tsx
   import GoogleAnalytics from "./GoogleAnalytics";

   export default function RootLayout({ children }: RootLayoutProps) {
     return (
       <html lang="en">
         <Analytics />
         <SpeedInsights />
         {process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID && (
           <GoogleAnalytics
             measurementId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID}
           />
         )}
         <body className="bg-[#f8fbff]">
           <ClientSdkProvider>{children}</ClientSdkProvider>
           <Footer />
         </body>
       </html>
     );
   }
   ```

4. **Track custom events:**

   ```tsx
   import { useAnalytics } from "./GoogleAnalytics";

   function YourComponent() {
     const { trackEvent } = useAnalytics();

     const handleButtonClick = () => {
       trackEvent("button_click", {
         button_name: "banner_generator",
         page: "home",
       });
     };
   }
   ```

### 2. Microsoft Clarity - Free User Behavior Analytics

  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: `
    (function(c,l,a,r,i,t,y){
        c[a]=c[a]||function(){(c[a].q=c[a].q||[]).push(arguments)};
        t=l.createElement(r);t.async=1;t.src="https://www.clarity.ms/tag/"+i;
        y=l.getElementsByTagName(r)[0];y.parentNode.insertBefore(t,y);

For a comprehensive free analytics setup, I recommend:

1. **Keep your existing Vercel Analytics** (basic metrics)
2. **Add Google Analytics 4** (detailed insights)
3. **Add Microsoft Clarity** (user behavior)

This combination gives you:

- ‚úÖ Page views and basic metrics (Vercel)
- ‚úÖ Detailed user analytics (GA4)
- ‚úÖ Visual user behavior insights (Clarity)
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring (Vercel Speed Insights)

## üîß Implementation Steps

   - Create GA4 property
   - Add measurement ID to environment variables
   - Update RootLayout with GoogleAnalytics component

2. **Add Microsoft Clarity:**

   - Sign up and get tracking ID
   - Add Clarity script to RootLayout

3. **Track custom events for your NFT tools:**

   ```tsx
   // Track when users generate banners
   trackEvent("banner_generated", {
     tool_used: "banner_maker",
     nft_collection: "chimpers",
   });

   // Track game interactions
   trackEvent("game_played", {
     game_type: "chimpers_game",
     session_duration: "120s",
   });

   // Track NFT tool usage
   trackEvent("nft_tool_used", {
     tool_name: "metadata_viewer",
     collection: "chimpers",
   });
   ```

## üìä What Metrics to Track

For your NFT tools website, focus on:

### Essential Metrics:

- **Page views** (which tools are most popular)
- **User sessions** (how long people stay)
- **Bounce rate** (are people finding what they need?)
- **Conversion events** (tool usage, banner generation)

### Custom Events to Track:

- Banner generations
- Game plays
- NFT metadata lookups
- Tool interactions
- Social media shares

### User Behavior:

- Which tools are used most
- User flow through your site
- Drop-off points
- Mobile vs desktop usage

## üöÄ Advanced Features

Once you have basic analytics running, you can add:

1. **Conversion funnels** (track user journey)
2. **A/B testing** (test different versions)
3. **Custom dashboards** (combine data from multiple sources)
4. **Automated reports** (weekly/monthly summaries)

## üîí Privacy Considerations

Since you're dealing with NFT and Web3 users who value privacy:

1. **Add a privacy policy** mentioning analytics
2. **Consider cookie consent** (though GA4 can work without cookies)
3. **Use privacy-focused alternatives** like Umami or Plausible
4. **Allow users to opt-out** of tracking

## üì± Mobile Analytics

Don't forget to track mobile usage:

- Mobile-specific events
- Touch interactions
- App-like behavior
- Mobile conversion rates

## üéÆ Game-Specific Analytics

For your Chimpers game, track:

- Game starts/completions
- Score distributions

## Support and Next Steps

2. Add Microsoft Clarity for user behavior insights
3. Set up custom events for your specific NFT tools
4. Monitor your analytics weekly to understand user patterns
